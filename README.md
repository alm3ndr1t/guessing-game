# Guessing Game in Rust

Welcome to the Guessing Game project in Rust! This hands-on project is designed to help dive into Rust programming by applying fundamental concepts in a practical scenario, you will get acquainted with key Rust concepts, such as `let`, `match`, methods, associated functions, and even external crates.

## Project Overview

In this project, we'll implement a classic beginner programming problem: a guessing game. Here's a brief overview of how the game works:

1. The program generates a random integer between 1 and 100.
2. It prompts the player to enter a guess.
3. After each guess, the program provides feedback on whether the guess is too low or too high.
4. If the guess is correct, the game prints a congratulatory message and exits.
